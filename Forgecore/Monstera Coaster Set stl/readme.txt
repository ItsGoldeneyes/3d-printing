The Monstera is a super popular plant with its rather unique style of leaves. I surrounded myself with several different Monstera plants while designing this to make it as realistic as I could.

This Coaster Plant is an excellent way to store coasters, and get some more foliage into your home. Small magnets hold the leaves onto the plant, and they come off easily when you need a coaster. Snapping the leaves back onto the plant is also very satisfying!

There are a few different stem types and leaf types so you can customize your plant how you would like.

Components you'll need to order.

You'll need 1 magnet per leaf, and 1 magnet per stem.
