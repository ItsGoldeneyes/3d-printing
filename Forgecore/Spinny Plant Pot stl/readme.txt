This Plant pot is not only aesthetically pleasing, its also fun and functional. It is made from two parts that spin together, and has a build in drip tray to prevent root rot.

These pots were designed in collaboration with Hendrick's Design, who makes nice looking plant pots.

This design was inspired by those spinning containers, but made functional as a plant pot. If there's interest, I can make more styles of this planter as well, with different exterior patterns, or taller so it spins more.

Colors: Use natural colors like green, white, light beige, marble, etc for an aesthetic pot.
